#Female genitals with swabbable vagina and cervix

This motivation for this model was for use in community based interventions where it is necessary to teach women within communities how to collect vaginal and cervical swabs as part of community led screening programmes. This project is a collaboration between the BILHIV project and LSHTM Open Research Kits.

These models are derived from
